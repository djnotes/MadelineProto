# MadelineProto Container Image

An easy way to get started with MadelineProto.
All the MadelineProto requirements are already installed in this image. You can use this image with Docker or Podman. GitHub hosts the code, but the image is on Docker Hub.   

To get started run:   

`docker run --rm --name hello-madelineproto -ti -v `pwd`:/app:Z  powergame/madelineproto-container telegram_username`  

This will start MadelineProto, help you log in to your account and send a test message to the telegram_username you specified on the command line.  


To run a custom script, just put it in the current directory and run the following command:   



```
docker run --rm --name hello-madelineproto -ti -v `pwd`:/app:Z  --entrypoint php powergame/madelineproto-container your_bot_script.php  
```
